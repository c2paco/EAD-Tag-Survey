		<head altrender="history" id="a2h">HISTORY OF YMCA ARMED SERVICES WORK IN
		  WORLD WAR I</head> 
		<p>The United States entered World War I on 6 April 1917. On that same
		  day, John Mott, General Secretary of the International Committee of North
		  American YMCAs, informed President Wilson that the YMCA would help provide
		  services for the military forces. Less than a week later, the International
		  Committee appointed the National War Work Council to coordinate this work.
		  William S. Sloane, a New York furniture merchant and for sixteen years chairman
		  of the YMCA's Army and Navy Committee, was designated as the new organization's
		  chairman, and Mott as its chief executive officer. A specific military function
		  was assigned to the YMCA. Its duty was to assist in maintaining and promoting
		  morale and welfare. It had been proved in the Spanish American War and on the
		  Mexican border that YMCA service made better fighters. </p> 
		<p>The YMCA conducted its war work with soldiers in training camps and
		  troop trains in the United States as well as in Europe, providing recreation,
		  library services, bible study, and religious services. In France the YMCA
		  agreed to run the Post Exchange for the army, and thus sold candy, cigarettes,
		  and other personal items to the soldiers. War work went under several names,
		  including Red Triangle work and AEF work (AEF stood for American Expeditionary
		  Forces, which referred to the American army in France). The National War Work
		  Council also financed similar work for French soldiers under the name "Foyer du
		  Soldat." Additional work was carried out in Italy, Greece, Russia, and a number
		  of other countries. The YMCA also provided services to prisoners of war in a
		  number of countries. </p> 
		<p>In the course of staffing its assigned operations and the other
		  activities which fell to its lot along the way, the YMCA recruited a grand
		  total of 25,926 workers who, about equally divided between home and overseas
		  assignments, served under the Red Triangle. These workers were selected from
		  approximately 2000,000 applications. Women workers comprised about 20 percent
		  of the total, twice as many of whom served overseas as served on the home
		  front.</p> 
		<p>In November 1918, the YMCA conducted a fundraising campaign in
		  conjunction with six other welfare organizations: The YWCA, the Jewish Welfare
		  Board, the Knights of Columbus, the Salvation Army, the American Library
		  Association, and War Camp Community Service. The effort, known as the United
		  War Campaign, raised $192 million.</p> 
		<p>Immediately after the war, the YMCA followed American occupying forces
		  into Germany, working primarily out of the city of Koblenz. This was referred
		  to as AFG work (i.e. American Forces in Germany). Due to unsettled conditions
		  in the war area and the fact that a peace treaty had not yet been signed, work
		  among young men of Allied countries and among prisoners of war was still
		  continuing. In the United States, a postwar program of special significance was
		  an extensive educational service, financed by war work funds, which enabled
		  ex-servicemen to complete studies interrupted by the war or to secure further
		  preparation for re-entry into civilian life. </p> 
		<p> Although it received much praise for its work, after the war the YMCA
		  was the target of numerous complaints from soldiers. The allegations mostly
		  related to the YMCA's operation of canteens, and involved accusations that it
		  had sold items at inflated prices or items which were to be distributed free.
		  There were a number of official investigations into the YMCA's wartime conduct,
		  for the most part exonerating the Y.</p> 
		<p>Much of the historical information in this summary was taken from
		  <emph render="italic">Serving the U.S. Armed Forces, 1861-1986: The Story of
		  the YMCA's Ministry to Military Personnel for 125 Years,</emph> by Richard C.
		  Lancaster; and <emph render="italic">Summary of World War Work of the American
		  YMCA,</emph> a 1920 report published by the International Committee of the
		  YMCA. </p>

		<head id="a3">SCOPE AND CONTENTS OF THE COLLECTION</head> 
		<p>The records include minutes and related materials from major
		  administrative bodies, primarily the National War Work Council and its
		  subcommittees: the executive committee, the finance committee, the committee of
		  eleven, the committee of fourteen, the religious work bureau committee, the
		  overseas committee, and the committee of nine. Also included are press
		  releases, publicity bulletins, and fundraising materials; training pamphlets
		  for war workers; blueprints of buildings for war work; and correspondence and
		  reports relating to work in army camps. There are also reports and
		  correspondence relating the the dissolution of the War Work Council. </p> 
		<p>A major portion of the records consists of materials relating to the
		  United War Work Campaign, a joint campaign of seven American welfare
		  organizations, including the YMCA. These records include minutes, bylaws, and
		  agreements; correspondence, reports, and minutes of the committee of eleven;
		  correspondence of John Mott relating to the campaign; financial statements and
		  budget materials; press releases, bulletins, and promotional publications;
		  state and local fundraising materials; and staff lists. There are also reports
		  and publications of the other organizations which participated in the Campaign,
		  including the American Library Association, the Jewish Welfare Board, the the
		  Salvation Army. </p> 
		<p>Materials relating to various program departments include publications
		  of the Army Educational Commission; reports and publications of educational
		  work in France; and reports and publications concerning entertainment,
		  transportation, work by women, and work in the area of physical fitness and
		  recreation (the latter includes publications on the Inter-Allied Games held in
		  Paris in 1919).</p> 
		<p>Records relating to the AEF YMCA are also included in the collection
		  and consist of publications, correspondence, and minutes relating to work with
		  American soldiers in France; AFG (American Forces in Germany) materials,
		  including pamphlets for soldiers and reports concerning work with the occupying
		  forces; and leave area publications relating to recreational and site-seeing
		  opportunities in France and Germany. </p> 
		<p>A variety of materials contain personal reminiscences of YMCA work,
		  including narrative manuscripts, personal journals, interviews of secretaries,
		  testimonials of soldiers, and a historical statement. The collection also
		  includes three sets of personnel records for war workers: a punch card file, a
		  contract file, and a statements of returning secretaries. These provide names,
		  addresses, and information on YMCA war work service.</p> 
		<p>Prisoner of war work is documented by administrative correspondence,
		  budget materials, reports, news clippings, and publications for prisoners.
		  There is also a pictorial publication describing work with eastern European
		  prisoners.</p> 
		<p>A number of YMCA-sponsored newspapers for soldiers are included in
		  these records. The most prominent of these is the <emph render="italic">Red
		  Triangle Bulletin,</emph> reporting on work in France. <emph
		  render="italic">Trench and Camp,</emph> a joint project between the YMCA and
		  various U.S. newspapers, was distributed in military camps in the United
		  States.</p> 
		<p>Non-YMCA materials relating to YMCA war work and the war in general
		  include government reports and publications on matters such as selective
		  service, training camps, and regulations. There are also some reports to the
		  English Parliament on prisoner-of-war work.</p> 
		<p>There is voluminous material concerning the post-war investigations of
		  the YMCA's work. These include the eleven volume "YMCA Answer to the Inspector
		  General" and the five volume "Letter from E. C. Carter to William Sloane
		  Supplementing YMCA Answer to the Inspector General'; Answers to Criticisms";
		  "Report on the Investigation of the YMCA"; and articles and news clippings.</p>
		
		<p>Also included in the collection are materials relating to the military
		  build-up on the Mexican border in 1916. The YMCA followed the soldiers and did
		  war work there. These materials include promotional publications, news
		  clippings, press materials, <emph render="italic">Border Work</emph> (another
		  YMCA-sponsored newspaper for soldiers), blueprint maps, and a report on the
		  work. </p>
